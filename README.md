## DESCRIPTION

This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. The dataset used is a sample dataset containing 25 records of students with their study hours and corresponding scores. The model is trained and tested using the dataset, and the performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Max Error, and Mean Squared Error.

## RESULTS

The model is able to predict the scores with a reasonable accuracy. The Mean Absolute Error is 4.18, Max Error is 6.73, and Mean Squared Error is 21.59.

## CONCLUSION

This project demonstrates the use of simple linear regression for predicting student scores based on study hours. The model can be improved by using more advanced techniques and larger datasets.

## USAGE

To use this project, simply run the Jupyter Notebook file and follow the steps outlined in the notebook. You can also modify the code to use your own dataset or experiment with different models and techniques.
